I'm 23 years old and like playing games, watching and playing soccer, watching series, listening to (and trying to make) music and going out with friends.

I studied software engineering at Fontys hogeschool Eindhoven, where I graduated in 2019. During my study I have done some extra courses about Cyber security and Data science.

Currently I'm working at Aviva Solutions, where tools and techniques like .NET, Kentico, Sitecore, React and Azure are used.
